aient, and hence aa indiscriminate spoliation took piace, reaching
ω all ranis and all parties. lt became evident thartha struggle
tvae now between a licentioris army aad the whole inhabitants
of Italy. ln the meantime L. Antonius, brother ef the triumvir,
and then consul. along with Fulvia, the triumvir's wife, to secare
b Antooy some ofthe popularity with the soldiers likely to accras
from the division of the landa, persuaded Octavianus te leave to
dre officere of Antony the duty of assigning to his troops the lande
which fell to their share. These deapoiled by tlte letter fied ia
tarn to marianus, who at first was not unwilling to court the
popular favour by preteeting them. But he found that, afior all,
the army was his great support3 aad he finally entered into their
eeuse without restraint, while L. Antonius, ia· turn, thretv himself
an the people.

Thus there were two parties arrayed against each other ia open
war, the subject being the division of the lande-L. Antonius et
the head of the people, and Octavianus at thet of the army. The
siege ol Perusia, in Etruria. et the Trasimene Lake, where L.
Antonius was shut up by Octavianus, ended unfortunately for the

We mast-now loolr at the bearing which these events hare aa
the history of Virgil. When the division of the haran world
among the triumvire took place, the Ganls constituted one of the
provinces assigned to Antony. The clrargeof Gallia Transpadana,
that portion of Cisalpine Gaul which lsy between the Po sud
the Alps, and in which Cremona and Mantua were situated,
was given to Asinius Pollio, who was six years older than Virgil,
aad had been a faithful adherent us Julius Caesar. He wesnot
only a hrave soldier, bat a celebrated orator; and in addition ta
his historical labours, hed devoted himself to poetry. A friend
aad patron of poete, and a literary man, it ie sair to infer that he

’ foetered the growing genias ef the young Virgil, who aameunder
hie special notice, as living in his province, engaged in agricul-
ture and the service of tlte Muses. It was his office to divide
among the soldiers the portion uf the lande which lay in the
country over which he presided. tr the ordinary arcuum be
comest, Pollio must have found himself unable, by his own au·
thority, to reserva the lande of the poet, highly though he csteemed
him. Virgil had already written some of the Eclogues,¹ by which
he gave early promise of hie future fame; end in a friendly spirit
Pollio coenselled him to seelr the protection of Octavianus. We

bave no informetion how the poet obtained accen to Octavianns3
bathis prayer was granted, and his lande in the meantime se·

enred to him-a service which he celebrates in the first Eclogue.
