lt'was while retuming from one of these excursione that tbe
emperor rnet Virgil, on what was destined to ba the post's last
iouraey. He had contemplated, it is said, a tour through aresce
and Asia, to furnish him with more copious materiale, aad mora
lifelike observation, so that the Aeneid, now brocked out, but
all unpolished, might receive the last toucbes of bis master haud.
Augustus was returning from Samos, where he bad passed the ί
two preceding wintere, and rnet Virgil in Atheus. The latter,
either feeling already tlre incipient wealrness of diseasa or

r willing tc gratify his great friend, abandoned his first intention,

and agreed to return with bima At Megara, his fatal illness da·
velsped itsels, arni increased during the voyage to Italy. A few
days aster bis arrival at Brundusium, ha died,on the aad of
September, nu. 19, within twenty-three days of completing bis
fifty-first year, probably the same* year that witnessed the death
of the poet Tibullus. ·

According to Donatus, ha bad spent the later years of his life
partly in Sicily, bat chiefly in Campania. The delightfnl climata
and sceuery of Naplea being associated with his grenan enjoy-
mactabo directed that be should be baried rbere. Accordingly,
Augustus ordered his bones to be transferred thither, and a romb
was erected over them near ,the cio Puteolano on Mount Posilipo,
less than two miles from Naples. Α tornb (see teil-piace), almost
universally believed to bs that of Virgil, is still pointed out, in
a situation corresponding to that mentioned by Donatus,¹ and
bearing this inscription, referring to the birth, death, aud bnrial-
place of the poet, aswell as histbreefold labours ln theEclognes,
tlra Georgius, and the Aeneid :-

⁶Mantna me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nnnc
Parthenope. Gecini pascua, rura, duces!

This epitaph Donatus credulously assigna to Virgil himself.
His parents, we are told, lived long enough to enable him to

(Bencrka cn Italy, p. 138). Holdsworth (Renmrkc arrd Dissertatioar
aa Virga, p. 501) examines the matter at great length, aud decides,
it seems on good grounds, in favour cf the received action. This,
too, is the opinion of Gibbon (Miscellcaecus Worlrs, vol. ii. p. 204,
ed. 1796), Bostare, Cramer, aud Niebuhr (History aerchma vol. v.
