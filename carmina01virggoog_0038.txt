of Anchises is not that of Evander or Latinus, nor the youth of
Euryalus that of Ascanius, nor the bravery of Mezentius that of
Turnus, nor the rege of Arnata that of Didot The deides also

from that of Neptune, as the lineamenta and state of Venus are
different from· those of duno. The last objection -that founded
ou the character of Aeneas-seems tbe most serious and irreme-
diable of all, as it runs through the whole work, and affecte ita
power to please, apert from the question of originality. It has
been alleged that Virgil has here failed, because his aim was to
represent Augustus in Aeneas, and that the character of the
former was incompatible with heroic diguity. But, critically
considered, though this were the case, it would only prove that
he was destitute either of skill in selectim, or of that power of
creating a character which constitutes the true poet. There is
no question that he did intend to compliment Augustus. He had
personally experienced the searful woes to which his cotintry
had been subjected by the civil wars. He seems early to have
abandoned the partyofAntony, towhio'h his own retired and medi·
tative habits had probably never induced him to form an attach·
ment stronger than that which arose from the ties of personal
affection to some of its leading men. Thenoeforth he flung him⁴
sels entirely on the side of Maecenas and Augustus, as of men
who alone could h'eal the bleeding wounds of the country which
he so ardently loved. He fondly hoped that Rome would rival
Greece in asts, as she had before conquered her in arms; aud
he strove to do his best to accomplish this end, And in all this
Augustus was his hope, as itwas tlratof Horace dud other reflective
and leading minds of that age. But it seems an over-refinement
to suppose that in the heneid the characters are representatione
of those men that thronged the court of Augustus, or took place
in the events that affected hia history, and that the battles end
struggtes are intended to shadow forth the conflicta that raised
Augustus to the empire. Virgil seems to have had before him
in Aeneas, not a representation of Augustus, but a distinct con·
ception of a character noble in itself, though, unfortunately for
bia main design, it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to invest it
with interest when success is to accompany it. His design was, '
having before him the destinies of the mightiest empire that tha
world had ever seen, to give its founder a character befitting.
He was to be a man of worm affcctions, eager to see his storm-
budetted friends and followers at last reposing in peace, but with
implicit reliance on the will of Heaven, and determined to forego
all consideratione, not for himself, but for that posterity whose
destinies depended on his obedience to the behests of the gods.
Hence the pius demas sacrificet his own feelings at all timu tt
