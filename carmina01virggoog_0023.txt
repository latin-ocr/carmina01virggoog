Octavianus for a time on the side of the constituticoal party,
lauded by Cicero, and trusted, in appearance at least, by the
senate. ln ac. 43 he was sent by the senate, along with Hir·
tius and Pansa tha consuls, to relieve D. Brutus, whom Antony
¹ was hesisgiug in Mutina. ln this they succeeded, and Antony
ded into Gaul3 hut hoth the consuls were killed. The sensu,
however, from some mistrnst of Octavianus, instead of conferriog
the command upon him, directed D. Brutus to head the armies
against Antony, who was again becoming formidahle through the
sid of Lepidus, then commanding in Transalpino Gaul. Octa·
vianus, on his return to Rome, was at first ccldly received hythe
senate; hut the soldiers rerered the memory of Caesar, and their
influencs procured for him the consulship, and the outlawry of
the conspirators, cf course including D. Brutus, who was betrayed
hy his officere and alain-Antony and his followers being freed
‘from a sentence of cutlawry passed against him. lt was in this
year, a. o. 43, that the Second Trium vitate, which was to continue
for five years, was formed by Antony, Lepidus, and Octavianus,
*who sharsd among themselves the govemment of the world.
But it was necessary to put down their enemies at home, and meet
the troops under Brutus and Cassius, who were then engaged in
Macedonia and in the East. The former was done by a·searful
proscription, most mercilessly carried into effect against the per·
aonal enemies of sach member of the Triumvirats. To accom-
plish the latter, Antony and Octavianus crossed over into Greece,
and thence proceeded to Macedonia, where, in the two battles of
Philippi, Cassius and Brutus were defeated, and slew themselves,
a.o.42. Antony, unhappily for himself, proceeded to Asia, while
Octavianus returned to ltely. One cf the objecto of the latter in
doing this was to secure the support of the soldiers, by bestowing
on them laud, on which they might settle, and which had been
promised them attha very commencement of the troubles conss·
quent on the death of Caesar, as the reward ol' their services.
This is sometimes done in the case of veteran soldiers by our own
government, hut always in a new country, where nc hardship is
inflicted on any one; and it is supposed that thus tharsis secured
both a race cf aturdy cultivators and of brave adherents to the
parent country. ln the case of the Roman soldiers, it was inevi-
table that the grossest injustice should be perpetrated, and the
greatest misery occasioned, for the scheme was to deprive of their
estates the actunl possessore, und bestow them on the soldiers. The
miserahle inhabitants,despoiled of their lands and homeacrowded
to Rome, secking redress and assistance. Tha evil had spread
