in the sevonth summer astar the destruction ol‘ Troy, with tho
landing of Aeneas on tho coast os Carthago, and bis hospitable
reception by Diuo} In tlre'two following books Aeneas narrates
to Dido his wanderings, l'rom the downsall of Troy up till that
time. The fourth contains the loves ol Aeneas and Dido, the
departure os the former by the command of the gods, and the
despair and voluntary death ol the latter. In the flsth, Aeneas
visits Sicily, and in the sixth arrives in Italy, where, at Cvrmaa,
he descends to the shades, and has an interview with his satim
Anchises. The remaining books are occupied with his struggles
to obtain a settlement in Italy, the land destined to his rece-tha
offers cl Latinus, king ol the Latina, who agrees to marry tobim
his daughter, and give him a kingdom-the opposition ol' the
Rutulian king, Turnus, to whom Lavinia had been betrothed-o· '
the mustering of allies on both sides-the repeated desento oi
the Rutulum, in spite of the gallant deeds os Turnus-his final
overthrow and death, and the triumph os Aeneas.

Objections have been made to the Aeneid, altogether indepen-

dently ol its being an unflnished worlr. These resolve theou η

salves into Virgil's wantos originality, his alleged poverty οἱ
invention, the samsness oi his characters, aod, above all, the fatal
objection that his hero is totally devoid os interest To some oi
these no satisfactory answar can be given. It was an unfortu-

nate thing that he chose to sorm himself so much on tha model 2

oi Homer, and to trust too little to his own original powers. That

be bas done so cannot bo denied. Audis the question wera, 5
whether the Aeneid is to be read solely sor its own underivad

excellencies'l we should have to except a very larga portion.
But the question assumes a very different aspect when we wieh '
' to examine not the powers os the poet, but tha charmsol tha poem.
In this view we areat liberty to adrnire the new form in which

Virgil osten reproduces the thoughts of his master. The alleged r

poverty ol* invention, in incidents at least, is not so apparent. ¹

The repid changes os scenery and event, especially in the carly

books, are a convincing proos that his powers were not essentially l
deficient in this respect Nor oan theoberga of sameness os cha·
