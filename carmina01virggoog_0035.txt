these nrlld end tender imegee contrait with the powerful repre

of the Georgica, and with the descriptione in the Aeneid of the
navigetion and landing et the Strophades, the crashiug fall of the

lroalities are often portrayed‚ and thet to tha life, by Virgil, ae
eny one glaucing at the scene described in the first Eclogue will
at once admit ln one respect the Eclognes haue en original
merit, which it becomes us to notice. Without loeing sight of
that soflness which ie a leading characteristic of the true Idyl, he
gives tc some of his themes¹ a simple grendeur, which is so far
from being incompetible with rural imngee‚ thet the latter twinc

patron end friend of Virgil. It is divided into four books, each of
which treats of a different subject The first treats of the culti-

with sowing, and the different occupatione that are proper for the
different sensons. The second regards the cultivation of trees,
especially of the vine. The third treats of the varicus animale
thet ere more immediately useful in agriculture-horem, oren,
sheep, geete, aud dogs. The fourth is occupied with the care of
bees. lt is impossible to preise too highly the mode in which
Virgil hee executed thie worlr; and though the subject had before
exerciaed the pens both of Greek end Roman writers, und our
poet had especially before him the Opera rt Dies of Hesiod, there
is little of the close imitation thetis to be found occasionally in
the Eologuee. Italy was hie field, end be confines himself to
this; his aim being, in truth, to beneflt his countrymen. Talring
into view the popularity of Virgil, we are entitled to presume
that hie venes, passing from mouth to mouth, contributed mete·
teriully to effect the object which he hed in view. And we know
thet not only did the ancient writers on agriculture refer to him
es en unqueetionable authority, but we are told in modern Italy
his maxims ere found to be as sonnd as ever. Martyn-no mean
authority-even says: ‘Though the soil and climate of lteiy ere
