aar his necess at Perusia having placed all Italy in the hands

of Octavianus, Pollio was superseded in his commendanti the =

taslr of assigniug the landa committed to Cornelius Gallus, also
distinguished as a poet and orator, end Vama, both of whom had
been follow-pupils of Virgil under Syron, Even their favour did
not protect our poet from the viniense of the soldiery. The landa
about Cremona, which had, from favouring the conspirators, ren-
dered itself obnoxious tutha veterane of Caesar, did not suffice,
and Mantua, though not in the same position, was, from its
proximity, exposed ιο the same fate. Besides, Antonius Musa,
who was associated with Varus and Gallus, had private reasons
sor pressing hard upon the Mantuam. la the consequent seizure

‘ of their lands, the protection before given ιο the poet, and which

hc endeavoured to secure by celebrating Varus in his sixth
Eclogue, did not now avail him. He was obliged ιο fiee before
the sword of an angry soldier, and toolr shelter, it is said, with
his master Syron, where he wrote the ninth Eclogue, a. c. 40.
In the meantime Antony, who had behaved himself disgrace·
fully in Asia and Egypt, was summoned by his wife, while on
his march in an expedition against the Parthians, to support hia
declining cause in Italy. He met her in Greece, where she died3
but he sailed ιο Italy, where he found Octavianus at Brundusium
ready to oppose him· On the other hand, Antony had been
joined by a strong reinforcement, as Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus,
who commanded the constitutional fleet, was indueed by Pollio
to corno over ιο his side. ln these circumstances neither party

was averse to peace, which was conducted under the merliation ,

’ of Maecenas on the side of Octavianus, Pollio on that of Antony,

aad Cocceius, a common friend of both-an event which is com·

memorated in the fourth Eclogue. It was at this time that An· ,
tony married Octavia, the sister of Octavianus. Virgil now found 3
easy access to Octavianus, and either formed or confirmed his ’
friendship with Maecenas. liis landa were, in consequence, ξ
restored tn him, and if we may credit Servius, his inlinence war ,

strong enough ιο obtain a partial redress for tha Mantuana¹

¹We have thought it right, ia such a work as this, to follow the ¹
account of the varrous steps hy which the poet was ultimately ss·

oured in his property, aa given insubstantia ly the same manner by l

all the modern writers who have carefullp consulted Donatus, Ser· ²

vius, aad the other grammarians, amougt

emost elaborate of whom l

are La Rue, Heyne, Jahn, and Forhiger. But we think it would l
not bo difficult to show, fromthe positiones Pollio, and the situation 1
of Gaul rn reference to Octavianus, that the application of Virgil to ’
Octavianus rs aced too early. Without catering into the reasons ,

h

clusina itself. virgil, aswell as the other Mantuam, enjcyed his ’
lands ru peace whr e Gaul was under the rdmimstmtion of Pollio.
