PREFAClh

Τιι text of this edition of Virgil is mainly adopted from thet
of the school edition os Wagner, published at Leipzig in 1845.
In certain matters of orthography, the mode usually pursued in
this country, end ιο which our dictionaries are adepted, hasbeen
employed, instead os that ιο which Wagner has been led, from
his faithful adherence ιο manuscript authority. Thus, for scupo-
Μ, saepes, maetltts, tentabunt, we have given componere, sepes,
mcum, tsntcbsml. Without entering into the complicated ques-
tions which asise on this topic, it has appeared to us that the
battle must be fought elsewhere; and that it is our province not
ιο lead in such matters, but to follow. The punctuation, on which
so much depende sor the right understanding of an author, has
been caresully attended to, and adjustsd so as best to bring out
the meaning, without that minute subdivision which serves to
perplex rather than ιο guida, ’ ’

ln the notes, the Editor has of course availed himself of the '
tuost distinguished commentatore, ancient and modern. Αι the
same time hu hasexercised an independent judgment in selecting
and adapting them, and in bringing before the reader such views
of bis own as he deamed ιο be useful. The great object hasbeen
to give such information and guidance on points grammatical,
critical, mythological, geographical, and historical, cs may lead
the learner to understand and to feel the aim, the thoughts, tha
allusions, and the beauties os the author, without interfering with
the exercise of his own powers and industry. Peculiaritiss and
anomalies in prosody are duly pointed out. Some attention has
been given ιο illustrate Virgil hy a compariscn with passages in
our own poets3 and these the judicious reaches will do well to
. multiply. Indead one great eim has been not only to inform the
scholar, hut ιο guida the less-experienced instructor as ιο the
points tc which it is desirable he should direct the attention of
his pupils. Hence it will be observed thatthe geographical and
mythologice! notices are of the briefest kind, aud enter only into
